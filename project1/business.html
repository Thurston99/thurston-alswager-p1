                <h3>The Comedy Magic of Rick Allen</h3>
                <p>Rick presents a 35-45 minute solo performing act that features interactive comedy along with mind-blowing magic.<br> Much of the magic is performed with borrowed objects from the audience, such as dollar bills and coats.<br> This, of course, leads to a lot of great situation comedy in good taste. This program would make an ideal after-dinner entertainment for that professional group.</p>
