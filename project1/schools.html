                    <p>This 45-minute school assembly program is ideal for K-5 audience. With personal stories and mind-blowing magic, your students will see and hear how I, as a ten-year-old boy used reading, to help achieve my goal of becoming a magician.</p>

                    someone from your audience will be levitated in mid-air!</p>
                    <p>During the show you can actually hear your students "ohh" and "ahh" when beautiful live doves make their magical appearance, a table seems to float, and yes, one of the kids from the audience will levitate in mid-air!</p>
