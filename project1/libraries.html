                <div id="quotesLibrary">
                <p>"Rick is an exceptionally talented magician and I highly recommend him for public libraries. He is wonderful about promoting reading during his show.<br>
                He builds rapport with the audience. He is respectful to the audience members that he chooses to work with him on the stage.<br>
                He is also aware whether everyone can see and offers pointers on how people can have a better vantage. His pacing and anecdotes are great.<br>
                Additionally, he utilizes a sound system and music which are highly engaging. As you can tell, I can't say enough good things about this performer.<br>
                If you try him out I guarantee that you will not be disappointed."                    
                </p>
